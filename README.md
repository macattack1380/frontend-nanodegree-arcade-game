# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Clone Challenge
## Instructions
To launch the game, there are two options;
- Download the entire repository via Git or Github and run via index.html
- Navigate your web browser of choice to https://macattack1380.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

## Game Goals
The end goal is to reach the uppermost row of squares navigating with the arrow keys. The small avatar will move one space at a time,
and is able to move in the four cardinal directions. Be careful not to bump into the bugs! They will send you back to the start immediately.
Upon reaching the far side of the game board the player will receive a game over message, and will be prompted to play again if they so choose.
